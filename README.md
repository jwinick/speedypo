# speedypo
SpeedyPO simplifies SKU management, sales reporting, and purchase order generation for e-commerce brands. A python-based platform, SpeedyPO utilizes Flask, MySQL, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap. 

The front-end is mostly saved in [index_10.html](https://github.com/jwinick/speedypo/blob/main/app/templates/index_10.html), while the backend is written in [routes.py](https://github.com/jwinick/speedypo/blob/main/app/main/routes.py).
